## JavaScript
* ECMAScript
* Variables
	* `var`
	* `let`
	* `const`
	* When would you want to use what?
	* What is variable hoisting?
* Comparators
	* `==` vs `===`
	* `&&` vs `||`
	* ternary operator
* Blocks / statements
	* `if (expression) { ... } else if (expression) { ... } else { ... } `
	* Standard `for` loop (`for (let i = num; i < otherNum; i+=step) { ... } `). Use cases
	* `for...in` statement. Use cases
	* While loop `while(expression) { ... }`
	* `switch(value): case (matchingValue)` statements. Use cases
	* `try { ... } catch (err) { ... }` statements. Use cases
	* `do { ... } while (expression)` statements
	* `for ...of` statments (tricky one)
* Functions
	* function expression vs function declaration
		* what is a named function expression
	* What is function hoisting?
	* What is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)? Why might you use one?
	* What is a closure?
	* `.bind` vs `.call` vs `.apply`
* Constructor Functions
	* What are they?
	* What is prototypal inheritance? How does it work?
	* What is the difference between a `class` and a constructor function? ([check this article](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-factory-functions-vs-constructor-functions-vs-classes-2f22ceddf33e))
	* Why would you use a prototype rather than defining instance methods in the constructor?
	* When would you need to bind prototype methods in the constructor?
* Keywords
	* `new`
	* `class`
	* `this`
	* `window`
	* `process`
* Primitives
	* number
	* string
	* boolean
	* undefined
	* null
	* symbol (new in ES6)
	* Are these immutable?
* Objects
	* Everything that's not a primitive is an object (so functions and arrays)
	* How can you access properties in an object?
	* Are object properties immutable?

* What is the call stack?
* What is the event loop?
